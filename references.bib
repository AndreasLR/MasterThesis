abstract = {Successive evaporation of two correctly chosen elements now make possible highly efficient X---UV mirrors. However, good results depend on two points: First we must know the manufacturing tolerances; these depend strongly on the spectral range and the refractive index of materials used for the coating. The other important parameter is the roughness of each interface, which can result in significant losses in the reflectivity of the mirrors. This paper examines both points. Specular reflectance measurements at 0.159 nm are very sensitive to the roughness of each layer. To demonstrate this sensitivity we develop a method of calculation of this reflectance taking into account the roughness of each interface of the multilayer.},

abstract = {A theory concerning the relation between the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of a plane surface and its specular reflectance at normal incidence has been reported previously for the case when the roughness is small compared to the wavelength of light. In the present paper the theory is extended with certain restrictions to shorter wavelengths. The inadequacy of parameters such as the rms roughness, the rms slope, and the autocovariance length for describing the reflectance in the shorter wavelength region is discussed. Particular attention is given to the problem of determining the distribution of heights of the surface irregularities from reflectance measurements at normal incidence. It is shown that for many surfaces, designated as normal surfaces, this distribution may be readily determined. Simple models for both normal and abnormal surfaces are used to illustrate the behavior of the reflectance in both cases and the consequent precautions necessary to obtain accurate height distributions. The role of the phase change due to roughness in determining the height distribution is also discussed.},
